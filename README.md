**A Little About Me**

I am a 3/4 Computer Engineer at Stevens Institute of Technology. I like software but I'm more interested in hardware. In high school I was in the Project Lead THe Way Program which allowed me to take a lot of engineering classes and ultimately influenced what I wanted to pursue in my career. I hope to get my master's degree after bachelors.
